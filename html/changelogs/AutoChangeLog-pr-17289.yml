changes:
  - rscadd: "Added a new trait called \"Reflexive biting\" that causes you to bite the hand of anyone who either pats you on the head or boops you on the nose. This deals one point of damage to the hand committing said offense. This also includes a verb in Abilities to toggle this off and on."
  - rscadd: "Added a personal space bubble trait that takes of priority over the biting trait, which dodges all attempts at hugging, booping, patting, licking, sniffing or hand shaking. This can also be toggled on and off."
