changes: 
  - bugfix: "Prevents being on fire from merely warming mobs up slightly in some cases. Mob fires also burn hotter."
  - rscadd: "Matches can now be used to light things adjacent to you when thrown."
  - tweak: "Made the effects of having a damaged robotic leg more prominent."
  - bugfix: "Robot limbs no longer cause pain messages. A reminder that you can still check their status with 'Help Intent' -> 'Click Self'."
  - tweak: "Knifing damage scales with weapon force and throat protection. Helmets only provide throat protection if they are air tight. Trying to cut someone's throat with wirecutters and/or while wearing an armoured sealed helmet will require several attempts before the victim passes out."
  - tweak: "Knifing switches on harm intent, in case you just wanted to beat on the victim for some reason."
  - bugfix: "Prevents knifing bots or silicons."
