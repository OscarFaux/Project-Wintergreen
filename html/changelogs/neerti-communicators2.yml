changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds NanoUI for communicators, the ability for communicators to call other communicators on the station, the ability for station-bound people to call ghosts, and for ghosts to toggle their visibility to communicators on or off in character preferences (defaults to off).  Communicators can now also support more than one call at the same time, for both ghosts and normal communicators."
  - rscadd: "Adds new machine to telecomms, the Exonet node.  It is very basic in terms of functionality, but certain services can be selectively disabled from it, such as newscaster updates, communicators, or external PDA messages.  Adds methods for building and deconstructing Exonet nodes."
  - experiment: "Adds framework for a fake-networking system called EPv2 that communicators will now use, and perhaps other machines will in the future, for good or for evil."
