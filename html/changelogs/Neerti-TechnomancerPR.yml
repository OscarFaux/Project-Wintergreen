  - rscadd: "Adds new 'info' tab for Technomancers that hopefully tells new them what they need to know."

  - bugfix: "Recycling core now actually works."
  - rscadd: "Adds two new cores. The Safety Core, which reduces instability by 70%, however it hass less energy, lower recharge rate and lower spell power. Also the Overcharged Core which uses more energy, caused more instability, but has far higher spell potency."
