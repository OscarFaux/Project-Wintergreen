  - rscadd: "Added new fire modes to various guns: c20r, STS-35, WT-550, Z8, L6 SAW, and double barreled shotgun. The firing modes work the same way as the egun; click on the weapon with it in your active hand to cycle between modes. Unloading these weapons now requires that you click on them with an empty hand."
