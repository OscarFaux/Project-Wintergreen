changes: 
  - rscadd: "Energy weapons and stunbatons now use special device power cells, these can still be recharged."

  - rscadd: "Stunbatons no longer require a screwdriver to switch cells."
  - tweak: "Tweaked the order in which stunbatons check for power, they should now visibly power off when their cell hits 0, instead of one hit after."
  - rscadd: "Security lockers (HoS, Warden, and Officer) now have an extra device cell in them."
  - rscadd: "Protolathe can print device cells."
  - rscadd: "Adds start_recharge() proc to energy weapons. When called, this should cause the affected weapon to begin self-charging."
  - rscdel: "Weapons that self-recharge won't do so for a short period after firing."
  - tweak: "On weapons that can fire both lethally and non-lethally, lasers drain twice as much power as tasers."
