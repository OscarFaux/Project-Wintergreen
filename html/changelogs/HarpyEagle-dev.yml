changes:
  - rscadd: "Shields no longer block attacks from directly behind the player."
  - rscadd: "Riot shields no longer stop bullets or beams (except for beanbags and rubber bullets), however they are now more effective at blocking melee attacks and thrown objects."
  - rscadd: "Energy shields block melee attacks as effectively as riot shields do. Their ability to block projectiles is largely unchanged."
  - rscadd: "Melee weapons (just energy swords, really) now only block melee attacks."
  - experiment: "Two handed weapons have a small chance of blocking melee attacks when wielded in two hands."
  - rscadd: "Sound and visual effects when blocking attacks with an energy shield or energy sword."
delete-after: false
