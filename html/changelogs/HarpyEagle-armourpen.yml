changes: 
  - rscadd: "Adds armour penetration mechanic for projectiles and melee weapons."
  - rscadd: "Laser carbines, LWAP, and shotgun now have a small amount of armour penetration, ballistic rifles (not SMGs) have moderate amounts, laser cannon has high armour penetration, and the PTR mostly ignores body armour."
  - tweak: "Shotgun slugs and Z8/STS damage has been lowered slightly to accomodate for their higher penetration. In general ballistics deal less damage but have higher penetration than comparable laser weapons. Notable exception: X-Ray lasers have had their damage lowered slightly but gain very high armour penetration."
  - rscadd: "Energy swords now have very high armour penetration. Ninja blades do less damage but ignore armour completely."
