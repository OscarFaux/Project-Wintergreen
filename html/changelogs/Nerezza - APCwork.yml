changes: 
  - rscadd: "APCs now have a new EMP behavior. Regular APCs shut off for a few minutes, critical APCs (engine and AI) shut off for 30ish seconds. Medbay will now not be permanently disabled by EMPs if no engineers are available to fix their APCs."
  - rscadd: "Bay's timed reboot interface for APCs has been ported for EMPed APCs."
  - tweak: "APCs affected by grid checks say so on their nanoUI now."
  - tweak: "APCs damaged by the apc_damage random event are now effectively emagged APCs. Anyone can operate their interface."
  - tweak: "Emagged APCs can now be repaired by removing their power cell and using a multitool to 'reboot' them manually."
  - bugfix: "Nin and twiz no longer **** up APCs if they drain the battery completely."
  - tweak: "Nin and twiz drain power from the wire an APC is connected to first, then drain from the power cell to fill the drain's 'quota'. Because the amount of power given from the power net is random, this means the battery will still drain but this also means you don't need to crowbar tiles in a room if the APC is empty."
  - bugfix: "Bluescreened APC wire panels now visibly open like they should."
  - tweak: "Bashing APCs open was only effective under certain circumstances, but would spam everyone anyway. This has been changed to only spam the user and to be more indicative of when you can bash the cover off."
  - spellcheck: "Full grammar pass on APCs."
