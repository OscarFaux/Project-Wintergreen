changes: 
  - rscadd: "Added a preference to control multilingual parsing behaviour, with a few different modes. Should hopefully be less punishing to people who stutter and use hyphens as a language key."
  - tweak:  "The examine mode preference should now persist across reconnections during a single round, but if the server is fully restarted it still appears to reset. This issue is also present for the multilingual preference, and I'm still looking into it. Savefiles are crpytic."
